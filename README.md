## General Info
Daily Planner is a simple to do list App made in React
## Technologies
Project is created with:


## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment:
- I built this app based on my own UI Designs.
- I worked with tasks on my personal to do list that i created.
## How to navigate on this project
The application uses Firebase authentication to sign up or Log in users.\
Users can then create chat rooms where they can communicate
## Why I built the project this way
I didn't use state management library such as Redux on purpose. For this app simple ```useState``` is sufficient. I realised that more and more projects don't use Redux since GraphQL or react-query are often used to manage data.\

## If I had more time i would change this
- Create more precise commits
- Create branches and use pull requests to generate a good workflow
- Use Trello to handle my tasks during development
- Improve on the UI
## Available Scripts
```
$npm start
```
